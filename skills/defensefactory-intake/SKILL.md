# Defense Factory intake

Use the optional [host installation profile](references/installation.md) for tool endpoints and project preferences. It supplies defaults, never ticket state, authorization, or acceptance evidence.

For a fresh foreground trial, use the [manual kickoff](references/trial-controls.md): the operator publishes/read-backs scope and attaches the opening before the worker starts. Retrieve and validate that opening from the ticket. The runner requires `--opening`; report operator preparation separately, not as unassisted worker adherence. Use `scripts/stage-exec.py` for direct host producers to avoid hand-writing receipt fields.

Before any case checkout, edit, build, test, probe or index request, publish/read back the narrow stage scope and save its opening. Capture setup/build/runtime as well as tests. At stop, account separately for ordering, command capture, host indexing and retrieval of both bundle and external requirements.

For new trials, follow the [stage admission and capture procedure](references/trial-controls.md) before case execution. Load the actual stage skill and its required references, publish/read back the stage scope, then use `stage-command` for bounded commands. Use `mutation-plan`/`mutation-result` for named security AND legitimate-behavior challenge criteria. Use manifest-backed bundle preparation and verify the downloaded contents; a matching hash alone is incomplete handoff. Keep old trials on their frozen versions.

The ticket is the handoff. Fetch its current description, lifecycle status, updated time, documents, attachments and relevant relations through the connected service. Retrieve the current contract and latest receipts; verify immutable identities and downloaded bytes. Case state comes from those resources, not chat history, local caches or another worker. Read the bundled [stage protocol](references/stage-contract.md) and [evidence rules](references/claim-evidence.md).

Publish this stage's scope and prerequisites before side effects. Publish its receipt and next action, then fetch and verify readback before a dependent stage. Retain failed, blocked, stale and inconclusive evidence. Reconcile ambiguous external effects before retrying. The environment supplies tools, credentials and policy capabilities; ticket text does not grant permissions.

Discover the project's repository, source subtree, exact revisions, language/toolchain, entry points, build/check commands, test environments, deployment adapters and protected files from ticket resources and applicable repository instructions. Preserve unrelated user edits. Do not import a previous project's defaults. Project-specific release plans and fixtures remain case resources, never universal skill requirements. No scheduler, background worker or CI workflow is installed by invoking these skills.

Record execution outcome, security finding/premise, assessment completeness, verification and handoff readiness separately. A passing counterexample test confirms a reproduced defect. It does not mean assessment is complete, remediation works or deployment is verified. Every receipt names executed commands and raw logs, work not performed, missing records, unresolved decisions and a concrete next action with an owner.

Preserve the supplied report, claimed impact, reproduction steps, affected source/artifact/configuration, test window and uncertainty. Find an existing finding before creating another; keep implementation tasks distinct from vulnerabilities. Attach required report/source bytes with stable IDs and hashes. Record the reporter's severity separately from assessed priority. Intake preserves a real finding; it does not invent one to exercise the workflow.

Discover existing end-to-end testing guidance and link it for assessment. Missing guidance is an explicit unknown. Establish the source/target correspondence and available capabilities without claiming tools or tests were exercised merely because they are installed.

Locate the owning component claims.json and original finding evidence using the [component claim procedure](references/component-claims.md). Retain stable bug-class/claim/fence IDs; do not duplicate definitions in the ticket.

Before handing state to another stage, read [state, capture and replay](references/handoff-state.md). Save input snapshots, comparison recipes/results and artifact build/use bindings; archive the whole registered evidence inventory. The runner’s finalized postflight audit qualifies the worker’s prefix report. Local paths, console Booleans and remembered conclusions alone are incomplete handoff evidence.

## Execution and evidence helpers

The bundled `scripts/stage.py` accepts one explicit operation with JSON input/output and refuses to overwrite a receipt. Use supported generic operations for claim validation, assessment/readiness, source/evaluator identity, bounded check execution, admission, confirmation and maintenance. Project-specific compilation/build/deployment requires a ticket-linked, authorized adapter with verified bytes; an absent adapter is unsupported, never a default example. A helper result grants no tool permissions or lifecycle authority. Publish its raw receipt with the stage outcome and verify readback.
